Waterflow, a toy app vaguely inspired from Airflow as an excuse to practise basic scala stuff.

# Goal

Find an excuse for using the following Scala techniques:
* enums of case classes
* exports
* scalatest with property-based testing
* tail recursion
* type classes, given/using
* context bound in parametric functions or type


# How to run

```sh
sbt run
```
